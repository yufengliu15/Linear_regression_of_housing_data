# Linear Regression
Using the data from Lowest-rent, I creates a linear regression model that would be able to predict rental prices per month, based off of user input of number of beds, baths and square footage.

# Objectives
- Learn how to create a linear regression model
- Learn how to encorporate a data set into the model
- Learn how to output the data in a clean and efficient format.

Above is an example of what the user interface is like. 

# Challenges
I spent way too much time on figuring out how to implement the user interaction. This was mainly due to how I used my data. In order to make the linear regression as efficient as possible, I used a z score normalization function. If the user wished to input a number for beds for example, inputing 3 would break my model, since the data it was based off of was already normalized. Thus, I had to add the user input to X_train, and then normalize them altogether. 

Another issue was the way rentals.ca displayed their data. Some properties had ranges, such as 1-3 beds. I had to write a script that would exclude all instances of "-", which cut my dataset in half. Along with that, many property owners would put 4 beds, 2 baths and $700 for example. Here, they mean that only 1 room is available, which would inevitably skew my model. Because there is no concrete way of finding the outliers, I decided to leave it in. 

# Libraries
Using numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, csv, copy and math.
